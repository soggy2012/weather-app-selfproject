# üå§Ô∏è Weather App

This is a challenge project where i made a responsive weather app built with **React** and **Tailwind CSS**, powered by the **OpenWeatherMap API**.


I'm currently learning React and created this project as part of my learning process. I received help from resources like **Stack Overflow**, **YouTube**, **GitHub**, and **GitHub Copilot** to better understand the concepts and troubleshoot issues.

## Features

-  Geolocation-based weather detection  
-  City search with error handling  
-  5-day weather forecast  
-  Dynamic background and icons based on weather conditions  
-  Responsive design for all screen sizes

## Tech Stack

- React + Vite  
- Tailwind CSS  
- OpenWeatherMap API  
- Font Awesome (for icons)

## Notes

- This project is hosted on **Vercel**, which allows secure handling of environment variables like the OpenWeatherMap API key.
  
- While the current version is fully functional, I plan to improve the app's design and add new features such as:
  - Day/Night theme switching
  - Celsius ‚Üî Fahrenheit toggle
  - React Particles (rain or snow effect) for visual enhancement
