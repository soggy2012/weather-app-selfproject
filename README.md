# üå§Ô∏è Weather App

This is a challenge project where i made a responsive weather app built with **React** and **Tailwind CSS**, powered by the **OpenWeatherMap API**.
I'm currently learning React and built this project as part of my learning process. I have gotten help from other resources such as Stack Overflow, Youtube, Github and Github Copilot to better understand the concept and also troubleshooting the issues that i've faced.

## Features

-  Geolocation-based weather detection  
-  City search with error handling  
-  5-day weather forecast  
-  Dynamic background and icons based on weather conditions  
-  Responsive design for all screen sizes

## Tech Stack

- React + Vite  
- Tailwind CSS  
- OpenWeatherMap API  
- Font Awesome (for icons)

## Notes

This project is hosted on **Vercel**, which allows secure handling of environment variables like the OpenWeatherMap API key.
I'm not completely satisfied with the web-app however, which is why i will most likely redesign some formats and add more features such as switching between day and night, change celcius to fahrenheit, experiment with react particles, etc.
